# PETER
hi, these are all the software components that run for Peter.
The one c++ file you can find is actually built into peter, but due to hardware limitations, most of these run on a seperate computer that talks to him via bluethooth. 
These are all python scripts. They are probably not very efficient, but they do the job.

if you would like to run this code on your own device, make sure to :
1. download python 3.11 or higher
2. install pygame via the terminal using : pip install pygame
3. install json via the terminal using  : pip install json
4. open PeterFile and change the path of the variable 'image' to were you have downloaded your files
5. run PeterFile
that should get everything in a working state

Thats all i have to say,
Lars Dekkers
